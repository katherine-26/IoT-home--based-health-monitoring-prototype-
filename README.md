# IoT-Based Home Health Monitoring System

This project is a home-based health monitoring prototype that uses an *ESP32 microcontroller* and sensors to collect real-time environmental data such as temperature and humidity. The data is displayed on a web dashboard using [lovable.app](https://lovable.app), providing an easy-to-use interface for remote patient monitoring.

## Key Features

- *ESP32 Microcontroller* for Wi-Fi connectivity
- *DHT22 Sensor* to monitor temperature and humidity
- *Web Dashboard* built with [lovable.app](https://lovable.app)
- Real-time data transmission and visualization
- Buzzer alert for abnormal readings (optional)
