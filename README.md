# IoT-Based Home Health Monitoring System

This project demonstrates a simple Internet of Things (IoT) prototype designed to remotely monitor vital signs such as body temperature and heart rate using an ESP32 microcontroller. The system is intended to assist both caregivers and patients by providing continuous, real-time health data through a web dashboard.

## Features

- Simulated data collection using DHT22 and MAX30102 (via Wokwi simulation)
- Transmission of data from ESP32 to a cloud-hosted web dashboard (lovable.app)
- Visualization of health data such as heart rate and temperature
- Alerts and potential for future integration of cloud storage (e.g., Firebase)

## Video Demonstration

Watch the demo video for a detailed walkthrough of the system, its components, and how it benefits both patients and caregivers:

## Technologies Used

- *ESP32 Microcontroller*
- *Wokwi Simulator* (for virtual testing)
- *lovable.app* (custom lightweight cloud dashboard)
- *HTML/CSS/JavaScript* for the dashboard UI

## Future Work

- Integration with real sensors and hardware
- Secure cloud-based storage (e.g., Firebase or similar)
- Enhanced alert system and caregiver feedback mechanism
